# Immersive Festival Dialogue

A Stardew Valley Content Patcher mod that adds dialogue for characters during festival events based on what your relationship status is! It gets boring going to the festivals year after year and hearing the same old thing come out of everyone's mouth, regardless of what you've been through together! This mod aims to fix that -and make festivals worth going to again.

## Progress

**Done so far:**
- Sam
- Maru
- Harvey
- Sebastian
- Leah
- Alex
- Abigail
- Penny
- Elliott

**Next up:**
- All the other marriage candidates
- Add more friendly dialogue based on heart levels

**After that:**
- Everyone else
- Translations

**In my dreams:**
- Dialogue for marriage candidates' friends and family based on relationship status - ie: Pierre really doesn't like me much because I divorced Abigail, or Jodi invites me to sit at her family's table when I'm dating Sam. 

We'll see if I ever get there.

## Download & Installation

**Download 0.9.0 - The Elliott Update**  
[Click here to download at Nexus Mods!](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2612)

**How To Install:**  
- [Install the latest version of SMAPI](http://smapi.io)
- [Install Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)
- Unzip this folder into `StardewValley/Mods`
- Run the game using SMAPI.

**Mod Compatibility:**  
- [Farmerjack's Dialogue Expansion mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/52020651?tab=user+files) edit the same festival dialogue files. Content Patcher will use whichever mod loaded last (they load alphabetically by mod folder name). It won't break your game, though. :)
- I will add more here as I test compatibility with other dialogue-altering mods.

**Thanks To:**  
Makco for helping me write Penny's dialogue!  
Pathoschild for making SMAPI and Content Patcher and other goodness  
Everyone in #modding on Discord for being so lovely and helpful!

**Feedback:**  
I don't have the time and patience to test every single scenario myself. Please let me know if you find any issues! You can do so on the Nexus, in the thread on Chucklefish forums, or hit me up in the SDV Discord server! You can also let me know if you think something seems out of character. Or just say hi :) Thank you!
